ðŸ‘‹Hello! 

I have been a professional translator for the last 5 years, and I am currently working on switching careers to become a software developer.
ðŸŒ±I'm currently learning computer science and programming through Harvard University's free courses: <a href="https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CS50 Introduction to Computer Science </a>(working on my final project) and <a href="https://www.edx.org/learn/python/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-programming-with-python" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CS50 Introduction to Programming with Python</a> (completed).

<p>I am currently working through the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Odin Project</a> curriculum: a comprehensive online course that will equip me to be a full stack developer.</p>

<p>Languages and technologies I am aiming to put in my toolbox:</p>
<ul>
  <li>html</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Flask</li>
  <li>SQL</li>
  <li>NodeJS</li>
  <li>MongoDB
  <li>Ruby</li>
  <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
  <li>React</li>
</ul>
  
<p>I also love to share what I learn and help others with my blog: <a href="https://codecraftingchronicles.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code Crafting Chronicles</a>. 
I share what I am learning, the programs I build, and provide updates on the coding challenges I engage with on a weekly basis.</p>
