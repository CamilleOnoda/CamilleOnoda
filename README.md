👋Hello! 

🌱I'm currently learning computer science and programming through Harvard University's free courses. 
I'm enrolled in CS50 Introduction to Computer Science and CS50 Introduction to Programming with Python. 

💞️My journey in the field of computer science is ever-evolving, and I'm passionate about grasping fundamental concepts as well as creating software and coding projects!

👀My goal is to hone my programming skills, tackle complex problem-solving, and contribute to open-source projects. 
I'm excited about collaborating with fellow computer enthusiasts and giving back to the GitHub community.

📫Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, suggestions, or if you'd like to collaborate on interesting projects.
