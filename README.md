ðŸ‘‹Hello! 

ðŸŒ±I'm currently learning computer science and programming through Harvard University's free courses: <a href="https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CS50 Introduction to Computer Science</a> and <a href="https://www.edx.org/learn/python/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-programming-with-python" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CS50 Introduction to Programming with Python</a> (working on my final project with Python).

I started learning HTML and CSS fundamentals with the courses provided by <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Team Treehouse</a>.
<br>I am currently going through the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Odin Project</a> curriculum and I aim to become a full-stack developper!

<p>I also love to share what I learn and help others with my blog: <a href="https://codecraftingchronicles.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code Crafting Chronicles</a>. 
I talk about what I am learning, share the programs I build, and provide updates on the coding challenges I engage with on a weekly basis.</p>
