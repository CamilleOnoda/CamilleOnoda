ðŸ‘‹Hello! 

ðŸŒ±I'm currently learning computer science and programming through Harvard University's free courses: CS50 Introduction to Computer Science and CS50 Introduction to Programming with Python.
   I am also gaining solid foundations in Python through the book 'Python Crash Course' written by Eric Matthes.

ðŸ‘€My goal is to hone my programming skills, tackle complex problem-solving, and contribute to open-source projects. 
   I'm excited about collaborating with fellow computer enthusiasts and giving back to the GitHub community.

ðŸ“«Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, suggestions, or if you'd like to collaborate on interesting projects.
